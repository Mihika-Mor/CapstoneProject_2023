While we do not anticipate any adverse effects, we will start with a limited numbers of male and female mice. The first round of experiments will assess the 5 daily doses of the single doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D2 and 6-hour exposure to 5-FU. A key measure is serum calcium levels which can be assessed the following day after experimentation. We will use this measure to determine whether serum calcium levels are within a normal physiological range. Assuming the first rounds of experimentation are successful, we will fill out the remaining experimental groups.\n"

Intestinal damage due to chemotherapy affects whether patients can receive the total amount of prescribed cancer treatment. Patient quality of life, both during and after chemotherapy, is also significantly impacted by intestinal damage. Patients undergoing chemotherapy frequently are vitamin D deficient. Experimental evidence suggests that enhancing vitamin D activity, could protect the intestine, promoting repair and decreasing inflammation in the intestine that occurs with chemotherapy use. Using a well-described mouse model, we want to assess whether the oral delivery of vitamin D compounds that enhance vitamin D activity improves the protection against chemotherapy-induced intestinal damage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tProvide a lay description of the project, its hypothesis and aims.\\n\\nThis question must be answered in everyday English; no scientific or technical words, acronyms or references should be used in this section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCancer patients undergoing chemotherapy often develop severe toxic side effects causing pain and distress. This toxicity impacts the ability of patients to tolerate and complete the entire course of cancer treatment prescribed, with quality of life affected both during and sometimes long after treatment. One such side effect is gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis, or\\n\\n\\n\\nsimply gut damage, which occurs early following chemotherapy, and often leads to dose reductions and treatment breaks in cancer treatment. Gut damage due to chemotherapy causes irreversible DNA damage to intestinal stem cells, inflammation, and cell death. This gut damage is characterised by smaller structures and a smaller surface area of the intestine, so a smaller proportion of nutrients can be absorbed via the gut into circulation. In addition, poor absorption of nutrients leads to higher water levels left in the gut than usual, resulting in diarrhoea. Severe diarrhoea leads to dehydration and malnutrition.\\n\\nCurrently, there are no effective treatments for gut damage due to chemotherapy. Identifying new and safe preventative treatments for this type of gut damage will lead to improved patient well-being and improve the prospects of prescribed chemotherapy continuing unabated.\\n\\nOne such potential safe therapy is vitamin D. A number of observations lead us to believe that vitamin D may play an important therapeutic role.\\n\\n\\tChemotherapy patients have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency\\n\\n\\tChemotherapy causes a decline in circulating and tissue levels of active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) levels.\\n\\n\\tVitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase inflammation and abnormal immune processes and increase gut cell death.\\n\\n\\tOral delivery of vitamin D compounds, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 19-nor- dihydroxyvitamin D has previously given effectively to raise blood levels of vitamin D metabolites and enhance vitamin D activity, in a manner that is safe for mice and humans.\\n\\n\\tOral delivery of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D has been shown to be absorbed into intestinal cells which are same cells that are impacted by chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\tDemonstrating that the oral delivery of vitamin D compounds can prevent intestinal damage due to chemotherapy will establish the rationale for developing the best therapeutic approaches for future human use.\\n\\n\\tWe have previously shown that when normal mice were given a drug by injections to stop vitamin D breakdown (VD1-6), there was protection against gut damage due to chemotherapy. Similarly, VD1-6 should reduce the breakdown of co-administered 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D and 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D when given in combination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe role that vitamin D 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D (and VD1-6) plays as a medication by oral delivery during chemotherapy has not been specifically investigated and compared between male and female mice.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe hypothesise that enhancing vitamin D activity via oral delivery will reduce in early phases of gut damage due to chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tUsing lay language describe what happens to the animals from the time they are obtained until the time the project is completed.\\n\\nThis question must be answered in everyday English; no scientific or technical words, acronyms or references should be used in this section. This answer should be a “big picture” overview of the project, from the point of view of the animals’ experiences during it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7-week-old male and female mice will be obtained from a CAF approved supplier and transported as per standard shipping conditions. When mice arrive at the CAF, they will be housed under standard IVC housing conditions with 5 mice per cage with standard feed and water and allowed to acclimatise for seven days.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt 8 weeks of age, mice will be fed a control diet containing defined calcium levels and receive daily oral treatments for up to 7 days. The treatment for each mouse will be either a control solution or one of number of active vitamin D compounds contained in 0.1 mls. In the morning, mice will be restrained to deliver their assigned treatment via a blunt ended needle designed to deliver a precise volume directly to the stomach, via the mouth. Each mouse will then be returned to their cage after each of their daily oral treatments, where they will then be monitored daily.\\n\\nOn the 5th day of oral treatments, all mice will receive 5th oral dose and then will be moved to the cytotoxic procedure room to receive a single dose of chemotherapy solution (or control solution) via an intra-peritoneal injection. The chemotherapy agent, called 5- Fluorouracil, is a cytotoxic drug and so mice will be lightly anaesthetised receive the intra-peritoneal injection, in order to deliver an accurate dose and avoid any risk of needle stick injury to the researcher. Mice will then be housed in the cytotoxic holding room, monitored 2 hours later, and will remain in the cytotoxic suite until the end of the experiment.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor half of the mice, the single dose of chemotherapy solution will given in the morning and will be humanely killed 6 hours later in the cytotoxic procedure room. For the other half of mice, the single dose of chemotherapy solution will be given in the afternoon. These mice will receive 2 more daily oral treatments in the morning and will be humanely killed 48 hours after the single dose of chemotherapy solution was given.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor all mice, at time of death, mice will first be anaesthetised to be able to collect blood via cardiac puncture, immediately followed by cervical dislocation.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlood collected will be used to measure blood levels for calcium and vitamin D metabolites. The small intestine, large intestine and kidneys will be collected to assess changes in tissues due to treatments (using histological and gene expression analyses.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tBackground scientific data, experimental plan and flow chart\\n\\nThis answer should include any relevant background scientific data.\\n\\n\\t\\tChemotherapy patients have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mucositis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tVitamin D deficiency has been shown to increase inflammation, abnormal immune processes, and gut cell death.\\n\\n\\tChemotherapy causes a decline in circulating active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) levels in patients, suggesting that low vitamin D activity contributes to mucositis.\\n\\n\\tWe have previously shown that 5-FU causes gastrointestinal damage called mucositis in mice.\\n\\n\\tWe have previously shown that when normal mice were given a drug to stop vitamin D breakdown (VD1-6) by subcutaneous injections over seven days, there was protection against gut damage due to chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\tOral gavage of active vitamin D enhances genes and protein levels responsive to vitamin D 5 hours after delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExperimental plan:\\n\\n\\t\\t7 week old male and female C57black 6 mice will be acclimatised in the CAF facility\\n\\n\\t\\tAt 8 weeks of age, mice will be assigned a treatment group (n=11/group) as per the table below.\\n\\n\\t\\tAll mice will be fed a semi-synthetic diet (0.2% calcium) for the duration of the experiment.

We also have extensive experience using 5-FU to induce chemotherapy-induced mucositis. We have performed safety studies with VD1-6 previously. We have not administered 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D2 by oral gavage before. However, we have previously delivered 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by both SC injection or mini-osmotic pumps over 7+ days without adverse effects. We have used Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in saline as vehicle for oral gavage in the previous studies without adverse effects.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tIf this project involves the use of an administered substance/ compound for which you do not have full knowledge of its effects, how are you going to manage this (e.g. perform a Pilot Study)?\\n\\nWe have knowledge of all compounds delivered mice. The oral delivery of vitamin D compounds has been previously extensively studied, but not in the context of chemotherapy. While we do not anticipate any adverse effects, we will start with a limited numbers of male and female mice. The first round of experiments will assess the 5 daily doses of the single doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D2 and 6-hour exposure to 5-FU. A key measure is serum calcium levels which can be assessed the following day after experimentation. We will use this measure to determine whether serum calcium levels are within a normal physiological range. Assuming the first rounds of experimentation are successful, we will fill out the remaining experimental groups.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tIf this is a disease model, include a description of how the model works. Detail the effects of progression of the disease process, identify humane endpoints, and explain your previous experience with the model.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is not a disease model, but rather a model of treatment toxicity. We have previously used C57black6 mice to investigate 5FU-induced mucositis, achieved with a sub-lethal single dose of 450mg/kg BW of 5FU with an end point of 48 hours post 5FU dose. No severe pain or discomfort to the animals was observed over the study period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tDetail the monitoring that will be made of the animals during the experiment, especially if surgery is performed or illness is being induced.\\n\\nNote: Once-daily monitoring should be carried out between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and as close to 24- hourly as is practicable\\n\\nAttach your Clinical Record Sheet(s)/Maintenance Monitoring Sheet at the end of this document and identify who will complete it and at what frequency. Ensure that the observation criteria and humane intervention/end points in the CRS are consistent with those detailed in Q3.6 and Q3.7\\n\\nA Cover Sheet should always be included. Exemplar Cover and Monitoring sheets may be downloaded from the Animal Ethics Webpages:\\n\\nhttps://mymailunisaedu.sharepoint.com/teams/rch/ris/animalethics/Pages/aec.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\nMice will be weighed and monitored daily for the duration of the study. Furthermore, mice will be monitored immediately after, and 2 hours post gavage. Mice will be monitored\\n\\n\\n\\nimmediately after IP injection and mice that receive 5-FU will be monitored twice on the day of injection. Clinical sings that will be monitored: ruffled coat, skin tenting/sunken eyes, lack of movement when stimulated, abnormal breathing, diarrhoea and hunching. If a mouse is found to be displaying signs of pain or distress it will be isolated and placed on a heat pad and given soaked food. If an animal scores 1 in any category mice will be monitored daily. If a score of 2 or 3 is recorded the University Vet will be called to observe the animal and monitoring will increase up to 3 times a day. A score of 4 or above mice will immediately be humanely culled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tList & describe any expected adverse effects of this project\\n\\n\\t\\tDescribe the effects of the full protocol (as opposed to effect of individual procedures) that you expect to see, and how these will be displayed by the animal\\n\\n\\t\\tInclude expected adverse effects of administered substances and of procedures that may necessitate premature euthanasia\\n\\n\\t\\tIf there is an expected mortality rate associated with this project, please explain and justify each possible cause of mortality. Attach a Running Mortality Sheet to the application; this can be downloaded from https://mymailunisaedu.sharepoint.com/teams/rch/ris/animalethics/Pages/aec.aspx\\n\\n\\n\\nThe effect of 5-FU over 6 hours is not likely to manifest in intestinal distress that results in weight loss. However, the effect at 48 hours may induce transient gastrointestinal distress where we may see diarrhoea. Monitor will occur 2 hours after IP injections for any change in animal behaviour. If diarrhoea occurs, then water will be added to the feed to help with hydration.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny mouse with a score of 1 will receive a subcutaneous injection of saline (0.5mL)). A score of 1 or more for profuse/bloody diarrhoea will require consultation with the University Veterinarian and follow advice. Given the short nature of the experiment, it is unlikely that weight loss will occur, which needs attention. However, a weight loss of ≥10% will result in veterinary advice being sought, and ≥15% will be sought immediately or immediately removed from the study and humanely killed.\\n\\n\\n\\nTreatment of vitamin D compounds are aimed at preventing gut damage due from chemotherapy. However, it is possible that vitamin D treatment itself may cause transient hypercalcemia. The doses and duration of treatment with vitamin D compounds are chosen not to cause hypercalcemia.\\n\\n\\n\\nOral gavage may cause oesophageal trauma or aspiration pneumonia. However, the gavage needle size is purchased to fit the size of the animal and are made of soft plastic. If trauma to the oesophageal occurs the uni vet will be called to check the animal.\\n\\n1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 oral administration has been shown to cause transient moderate hypercalcemia. However, the dose rate and duration the mice will receive has been shown not to cause hypercalcemia. Transient moderate hypercalcemia does not cause adverse effects and will not cause mortality.\\n\\nOral 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D3 does not cause hypercalcemia.\\n\\nVD1-6 does not cause hypercalcemia when administered at this or higher concentrations or longer durations of treatments.\\n\\nThe combinations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and VD1-6, or 19-nor-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and VD1-6 may cause transient hypercalcemia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tPre- and post-operative care (for projects involving surgery)\\n\\n\\n\\nN/A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tWhat will happen to the animal at the end of the procedure or project?\\n\\n\\t\\tIf it is to be humanely killed, what method is to be used?\\n\\n\\t\\tHow will you determine the animal is dead?

Your answer should address the 3Rs, Replacement, Reduction & Refinement. (See Clauses 1.18–1.30 of the Code).\\n\\n“Not applicable” is not acceptable.\\n\\nMake sure each of the dot points is addressed\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Ethical Issues\\n\\n1A) What is the welfare cost to the animal? Discuss the overall, i.e. cumulative, impact of the protocol\\n\\n1B) What is the justification for this level of pain/distress?\\n\\nTip: Start with the welfare cost to the animal, not the research benefit (i.e. follow the question order). This is your chance to articulate the cost- benefit.\\n\\nThis is a short term study and effects of minimal (5 or 7) daily oral gavage and chemotherapy are expected to be minimal. The use of Vitamin D, a compound that is approved for consumption with out prescription, as a therapeutic to chemotherapy patients experiencing mucositis has been shown to reduce the progression of chemotherapy induced intestinal mucositis.\\n\\n\\n\\nTreatment of vitamin D compounds are aimed at preventing gut damage from chemotherapy. However, it is possible that vitamin D treatment itself may cause transient hypercalcemia. The doses and duration of treatment with vitamin D compounds are chosen not to cause hypercalcemia.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe novel vitamin D compounds are hypothesised to be a protective agent on the intestine during the chemotherapy treatment and therefore are expected to have minimal welfare cost to the animal alone, however the chemotherapy agent has the potential to cause moderate pain and distress. Any acute effects will be managed via CRS. The cost/benefit of the planned studies is favourable as the knowledge gained will impact clinical studies in which potential new options for maintaining or increasing vitamin D levels could be administered for intestinal health during chemotherapy treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we do not anticipate any adverse effects, we will start with a limited numbers of male and female mice. The first round of experiments will assess the 5 daily doses of the single doses of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 19-nor- dihydroxyvitamin D2 and 6-hour exposure to 5-FU. Assuming the first rounds of experimentation are successful, we will fill out the remaining experimental groups.\\n\\n2. Reduction:\\n\\nTip: This should include how the power calculation relates to the numbers of animals requested, sharing of controls, randomisation and blinding, re-use of animals (carefully justified!), other designs (washout phase, crossover) if they reduce animal numbers.\\n\\nA power calculation has determined the number of mice to be the minimum number to give statistically significant results with appropriate controls based on 80% power with significance set at a p-value of less than 0.05. The values used in the power calculation are derived from previous gastrointestinal tract studies using 5-FU and the expected means and standard deviations of mRNA levels of recognised genes associated with gastrointestinal damage. Our tissue collection and subsequent experimentation techniques are also of such a high standard that we do not use additional numbers to account for collection, storage or experimentation ‘errors’ that may result in the loss of samples.\\n\\n\\tRefinement:\\n\\n\\tInclude steps that will be taken to mitigate the stressors discussed in Q3.11.1\\n\\n\\tInclude any other actions that will be taken to improve wellbeing\\n\\nTip: Focus on the animal’s experience\\n\\nand what will support its wellbeing.\\n\\nWe have been working with chemotherapy-induced mucositis for over 14 years. Our experimentation techniques have been refined over this time, so we can now minimise the pain and distress caused to the animals as much as possible. We have determined that this is the most appropriate model for investigating treatments for chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal damage. Heat mats will be used if mice are cold to touch to help maintain body temperature. Mice are monitored, and any situation of discomfort will be addressed if required.\\n\\n\\tReplacement Consideration of Alternatives\\n\\nYour response should include the following:\\n\\n\\tA list of any potential alternatives to animal use\\n\\n\\tWhether any of these alternatives would be used\\n\\n\\tDetails of literature searches you have undertaken including databases searched and key words used)\\n\\nThis answer should explain why animals need to be used at all.\\n\\nWe have tested compounds in an in vitro setting to test compound effects on intestinal epithelial cells. These compounds appear to have positive impacts on intestinal cells. However, to test a novel compound on the intestine as a whole organ, there is no replacement for the proposed mouse model. We have also confirmed this with literature searches in Medline databases (carried out August 2022).\\n\\nSearch terms used were 5-FU, mucositis, and vitamin D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tOTHER INFORMATION\\n\\n\\tIn what way does this application relate to your previous or concurrent work? What new information or understanding will this project provide?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is useful for the AEC to understand how this proposal fits into the broad research strategy/interest of your group. If this application relates to previous projects approved by this or another AEC, please include a summary of the previous work and explain how this project relates to the previous work.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe current study addresses the hypothesis that vitamin D treatments prevents chemotherapy- induced mucositis. The study also aims to compare the effect of VD1-6 with active vitamin D administration. This study also expands on the delivery method for VD1-6 (oral) as an effective mode of therapy, building on previous studies which show that VD1-6 prevents chemotherapy-induced mucositis under normal conditions. Furthermore, successful completion of the proposed study will define the requirements for future studies where the hypotheses address the effects of VD1-6 in cancer and mortality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tPublished articles relevant to this application\\n\\nSoares PM et al (2013) Inflammatory intestinal damage induced by 5-fluorouracil requires IL-\\n\\n4.

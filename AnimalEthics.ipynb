Intestinal damage due to chemotherapy affects whether patients can receive the total amount of prescribed cancer treatment. Patient quality of life, both during and after chemotherapy, is also significantly impacted by intestinal damage. Patients undergoing chemotherapy frequently are vitamin D deficient. Experimental evidence suggests that enhancing vitamin D activity, could protect the intestine, promoting repair and decreasing inflammation in the intestine that occurs with chemotherapy use. Using a well-described mouse model, we want to assess whether the oral delivery of vitamin D compounds that enhance vitamin D activity improves the protection against chemotherapy-induced intestinal damage.\n",

This gut damage is characterised by smaller structures and a smaller surface area of the intestine, so a smaller proportion of nutrients can be absorbed via the gut into circulation. In addition, poor absorption of nutrients leads to higher water levels left in the gut than usual, resulting in diarrhoea. Severe diarrhoea leads to dehydration and malnutrition.\n",
